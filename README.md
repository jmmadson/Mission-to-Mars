# Mission to Mars

## Overview

In this project we were challenged to scrape Mars data and images from four different websites using splinter and then BeautifulSoup to parse that data. Once I scraped the specific information I was looking for about Mars including recent news, featured image, facts and hemisphere images, I stored it in a Mongo Database, and used Flask push it to the web. 

HTML and Bootstrap were used to display the information in a user friendly and mobile responsive way.
